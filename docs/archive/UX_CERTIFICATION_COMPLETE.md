## 🔍 Validation Approach

### 1. Automated Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_ux_validation.py`) covering:
- Demo context file validation
- CLI argument support verification
- Context export/import round-trip
- Layout persistence infrastructure
- Visual theming consistency
- Error handling in critical panels
- UI polish features (splash, overlays, status bar)

**Result:** 15/15 tests passing

### 2. Manual Testing Framework
Created interactive script (`manual_ux_validation.py`) for:
- CLI flow validation
- Visual appearance verification
- Context loading from command line
- Mock mode operation testing

**Result:** Framework ready for capstone demo preparation

### 3. Documentation
Produced two comprehensive documents:
- **UX_CERTIFICATION_REPORT.md** - Detailed findings, test results, production readiness assessment
- **UX_QUICKREF.md** - Quick reference for demos and testing

---

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Batch File Fixes
**Issue:** Not all batch launchers passed through CLI arguments  
**Fix:** Added `%*` and `if errorlevel 1 pause` to diagnostics.bat and replay.bat  
**Impact:** All 5 launchers now support `--load` and `--mock` flags consistently

### Test Suite Expansion
**Added:** 15 new UX validation tests  
**Coverage:** CLI, context handoff, persistence, theming, error handling, polish  
**Integration:** Seamlessly integrated with existing 54 tests

### Documentation Enhancement
**Added:** Comprehensive UX certification documentation  
**Updated:** Main docs index to include new reports  
**Benefit:** Clear production readiness evidence for reviewers
