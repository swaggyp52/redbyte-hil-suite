## Remaining Minor Gaps (Low Priority)

### Acknowledged but Not Critical

1. **OpalRTAdapter implementation** - Documented as stub in HARDWARE_INTEGRATION.md
2. **Session comparison feature** - Listed as "future enhancement" in ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
3. **AI/Agents panel** - Correctly omitted (was optional in plan)
4. **Notes/Terminal apps** - Not needed for HIL context (removed from scope)

**Status:** These are **intentional scope decisions**, not gaps. Documentation explains why they're not present.
