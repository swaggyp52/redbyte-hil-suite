## ⚡ Navigate with Quick Jump Tabs

Located in toolbar after "Layout" dropdown:

### ⚡ Diagnostics
**Purpose:** High-density cockpit view  
**Layout:**
```
[3D System (large)]  [Insights] [Phasor]
[3D System (cont.)]  [Dashboard        ]
[Scope            ]  [Injector + Replay]
```
**Use for:** Live monitoring, fault diagnosis

### 📊 Timeline
**Purpose:** Event history and replay  
**Layout:** Replay Studio + Insights + Dashboard  
**Use for:** Session playback, event analysis

### 🌈 Spectral
**Purpose:** FFT spectrum analysis  
**Layout:** Replay Studio (Spectrum tab) + Scope + Phasor  
**Use for:** Harmonic analysis, THD investigation

### 🎛️ Grid
**Purpose:** All panels in balanced arrangement  
**Layout:** 8 panels tiled evenly  
**Use for:** Full system overview

### 🎯 Minimal
**Purpose:** Essential monitoring only  
**Layout:** Scope + Phasor (large views)  
**Use for:** Clean presentations, focused monitoring

**How to use:**
1. Click any Quick Jump button
2. System instantly switches layout
3. Overlay confirms: "⚡ Jumped to [Mode] View"

---

## 📍 Experience Auto-Pinning

**What is it:** System automatically positions relevant panels when insights detected

### Auto-Pin Triggers

**Unbalance/Phase Issues → Phasor View (top-left)**
- When: "Phase Unbalance" insight detected
- Why: Phasor shows angular deviations visually
- Action: Phasor floats to prominent position

**Harmonic/THD Events → Spectrum Analysis (top-left)**
- When: "Harmonic Bloom" or high THD
- Why: Spectrum tab shows frequency content
- Action: Replay Studio opens on Spectrum tab

**Frequency Events → Scope + Insights (split)**
- When: "Frequency Undershoot" detected
- Why: Scope shows real-time freq, Insights shows history
- Action: Both panels positioned for comparison

**Recovery Events → Dashboard (bottom-right)**
- When: "Recovery Delay" insight
- Why: Dashboard shows compliance metrics
- Action: Dashboard positioned for validation review

**How to see it:**
1. Inject fault (Fault Injector panel)
2. Wait for insight detection (~1-2 seconds)
3. Relevant panel auto-pins with overlay message
4. Close panel or switch layout when done

---

## 🎯 Use Enhanced Phasor View

### Event Markers (⭐)
**What:** Star symbols mark significant events on phasor diagram

**When added:**
- Tag clicks in Replay Studio
- Peak THD moments (>5%)
- Manual event triggers

**How to see:**
1. Open Phasor View
2. Let system run for ~10 seconds
3. High THD events automatically marked
4. Last 10 events persistent

### Angular Deviation Bands
**What:** Semi-transparent blue arcs showing ±15° tolerance zones

**Purpose:** Visual feedback on phase alignment quality  
**Positions:** 0°, 120°, 240° (ideal 3-phase)

**How to toggle:**
```python
# Programmatically (for custom scripts)
phasor_view.update_deviation_bands(show=True, tolerance_deg=15)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Phasors inside bands: Good alignment ✅
- Phasors outside bands: Phase error ⚠️

## 📊 Explore Scope Energy Ribbons

### Energy Ribbons
**What:** RMS bands overlaid on live waveforms

**Features:**
- Color-coded by phase (yellow, green, magenta)
- Opacity based on THD (higher THD = more opaque)
- 20px wide semi-transparent lines

**How to see:**
1. Open Inverter Scope (Voltage mode)
2. Let system acquire data (~3 seconds)
3. RMS bands appear behind waveforms
4. Watch opacity increase during faults

### Mini-FFT Sparkline
**What:** FFT analysis tooltip on mouse hover

**How to use:**
1. Hover mouse over scope waveform
2. Mini-FFT label appears below plot
3. Shows: `⚡ FFT @ t=X.XXXs: Peak XXHz (XXV)`
4. Move cursor to analyze different time windows

**Window size:** 64 samples centered on cursor  
**Update:** Real-time as you move mouse

3. **Engineer View** - Scope + Phasor + Injector + Sculptor
4. **Analyst View** - Replay + Analysis + Dashboard
5. **3D Ops View** - 3D System + Phasor + Injector

### Switch Layouts
**Method 1:** Use Layout dropdown in toolbar  
**Method 2:** Use Quick Jump tabs  
**Method 3:** Drag panels manually (layout saved automatically)

### Layout Memory
**Auto-saved to:** `config/last_layout.json`  
**Restored on:** Application restart

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Stylesheet Not Visible
**Issue:** UI appears unstyled  
**Fix:** Stylesheet applied after window shown (automatic)

### Layout Resets on Preset Change
**Issue:** Panels jump around unexpectedly  
**Fix:** Layout locking prevents this (automatic)

### Animations Laggy
**Issue:** Low frame rate on animations  
**Check:** GPU acceleration enabled (pyqtgraph OpenGL)

### Tooltips Not Appearing
**Issue:** Hover doesn't show tooltips  
**Fix:** Ensure `apply_all_tooltips(window)` called in MainWindow.__init__
